			DEVOPS ASSIGNMENT  3

[0]  Docker compose is a tool for running multiple conatiners. It uses an YAML file for configuration. We can create and start services with a single docker command.

[1]  Dockerfile is a document in from which we can build our base image. It can be used for a single image while docker compose is a tool with which we can club multiple containers together.
We have to specify the version number of the dockercompose. There is a structure followed to write into both the files. Dockerfile allows us to run one container while docker-compose allows us to assemble multiple containers.

[2]  version -  Denotes the version of docker compose we are using. Here, I used version 2.
services -  This defines all the containers we want to create. Here, mysql1,mysql2 and mysql3 are the three different nodes or containers. Since we want to build a three node cluster, we are using 3 services.
Mysql1 is our node 1. Mysql2 node 2 and mysql3 node 3.
build- It specifies the location of our Dockerfile and the ‘.’ represents the current directory where docker-compose.yml is located.
Ports - This is used to map our container’s port to the host port. Here, container’s port is 5000 and host port is 3306.
The similar is carried out for next two containers. Only change is we are mapping different port numbers for different containers to our single host port.
Indentation plays a key role in docker compose

[4]  If we did not use clustering for our example given here, we would have had to create 3 dockerfiles, 3 containers and run each of them separately as mentioned in the lecture. With clustering, it is very easy to club different images and configure them in a single go. If we have a dockerfile it makes us easier orelse we can just specify the image names and details and docker compose creates it for us.
